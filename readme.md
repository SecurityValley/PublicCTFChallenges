# SecurityValley CTF challenges

Hello and glad you found your way to this repository. Here you will find many capture the flag tasks from different categories. If you would like be part of the competition, you can register a free account here: <https://ctf.securityvalley.org>

## How does it work?

It's not that complicated, I promise!

Each challenge contains at least a description and an external link that gonna lead you to the challenge. In each challenge, you have the goal to find a flag. The flag is either in the format SecVal{} or there is an instruction how to format the flag, if you have solved a challenge. But the input format in the "solve flag dialog" is always SecVal{}. Keep that in mind.
